    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>My vision</h3>
    <p>We envision a world where all people affected by health challenges live healthy lives supported by a community that cares. To improve the health of the underserved and vulnerable through holistic information, education and advocacy.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>My Mission</h3>
    <p>We believe people have a right to accurate and
        unbiased information about all types of medicines
        including conventional, alternative and Integrative.
        We believe free access to health information is not a
        privilege, but rather a human right that should be
        granted to every individual regardless of geographic
        location, social class, or financial position.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Please Donate</h3>
    <p>We rely on your donations to pay for servers, bandwidth, maintenance, and development of the Human Health Project platform including salaries. We need a small paid staff of 5 to work with a volunteer team of 80 people. Your financial gift will help not only us, but people across the globe.</p>
