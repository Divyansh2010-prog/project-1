            <h2>Chest Muscles</h2>
            <p class="p1">Chest strength is about more than physical definition—strong pectoral muscles can help improve posture, benefit breathing and support the surrounding muscles and joints. While building muscle can take time, developing a strong chest doesn't have to be time-consuming: The key is knowing which exercises to prioritize.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Chest WorkOuts</h3>
            <p class="p2">
                Traditional Pushups,
                Scapular Pushups,
                Wide Grip Chest Press,

            <h2>Shoulder Muscle</h2>
            <p class="p1">Sculpting your shoulders doesn't require a lot of equipment or training, just a set of dumbbells. Dumbbells are versatile and easy to use, and they can strengthen more than just your muscles. They work your brain, too, as you try to balance and coordinate the movements. They help build greater overall stability in the area of focus. Shoulder strength training can reduce your risk of injury by strengthening your core muscles, which makes you more stable and lessens imbalances.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Shoulders Workout</h3>
            <p class="p2">
                Dumbbell front raise,

            <h2>Legs Muscle</h2>
            <p class="p1">When it comes to designing an effective leg workout, simpler is better. The basic lower body movements — squats, hip hinges (deadlifts), and lunges — should comprise the majority of your programming. These movements inherently focus on the major muscle groups of the legs: the glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves. </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Legs Workout</h3>
            <p class="p2">
                Back squat -> Target your posterior chain — or the back of your body, including the glutes and hamstrings — with a back squat,
                Front squat,
                Romanian deadlift,
                Good mornings,
                Walking lunges,
                Reverse lunge,
                Lateral lunge,
                Stepup.

            <h2>Back Muscle</h2>
            <p class="p1">If you've ever had back pain, you know just how frustrating it can be — and you're not alone. It's estimated that 60-80% of adults in Western countries deal with lower back pain. And because almost every movement your body makes engages your back in some way, this kind of pain can really put a damper on your activities. Strengthening your back muscles is one way to help manage or even prevent nonspecific back pain and improve range of motion.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Back Workout</h3>
            <p>
